# AD Project For Hibernate
## About
This is the final project made for the subject called Data Access in the degree of Multimedia App development (Superior profesional formation) in my second year.
In this proyect i use the Hibernate library in Java, used for the handling and mapping of relational objects in data bases.
Here i tackle with 3 types of methods, the generic ones provided by Hibernate and methods that use HQL, a version of SQL made for better query handling.
## A side note
Althought this project has 2 contributors whith similar names, its me. Accidentaly i used an older email in the local git repository, this is just an aclaration.
